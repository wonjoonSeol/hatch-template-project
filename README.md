# Effective Intervention

We use data-driven approaches to help you understand how effective your interventions to reduce sexual harassment and gender discrimination are. Or maybe you want to offer your help and skills in areas where resources are not used effectively to reduce the issues. Just come to us and we'll use our best stats to help you out.

This project was developed during [hatchlondon 2017](http://hatchlondon.io).

## Problem and Solution

Organisations, governments, companies and charities implement interventions to reduce gender discrimination and sexual harassment. But how well do they assess their effectiveness? We provide an online platform to present a data-driven analysis of incidents of gender discrimination and sexual harassment, coupled with data about the interventions implemented. You can use it to see if your interventions achieved their aims, optimize for the future and contribute to a community that aims to eradicate gender inequality.
